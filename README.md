# EconoCurrencyBot 
### Hack NA Project - Theme: Community Engagement
In this project, we coded a Discord bot that involves a fun multiplayer game involving the economy. With this bot, each user in the Discord server has a wallet and a bank account. Players can deposit or withdraw money from their bank accounts and send other users their money. Players can earn money by stealing from other users, working, playing the slots, or investing in stocks from the Nasdaq with values based on their real-world rates. Players can also change the currency they use with the current exchange rates. Our bot also provides a leaderboard with first place for whoever is the richest, allowing players in the server to compete for the top spot. This project aims to engage and connect members of any community through fun and interactive features. Whether it's investing in the stock market or climbing up the leaderboards, this bot provides a platform for users to interact and enjoy each other's company in an exciting and engaging manner.
